# tailwindcss-react-storybook

This is a starter for [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) with [React](https://reactjs.org/) components.

There's a similar starter [here](https://github.com/audunru/tailwind-storybook) that's built on top of Create React App, but usually I bring my own toolchain so I put together this starter that does not include react-scripts.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andrew-j-roberts/tailwind-react-storybook.git
cd tailwindcss-react-storybook
npm i
```

## Running Storybook

```bash
npm run storybook
```
